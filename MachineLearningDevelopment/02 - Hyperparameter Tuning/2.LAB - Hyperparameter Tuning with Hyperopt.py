# MAGIC **Other Conventions:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Throughout this demo, we'll refer to the object `DA`. This object, provided by Databricks Academy, contains variables such as your username, catalog name, schema name, working directory, and dataset locations. Run the code block below to view these details:

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Prepare Dataset
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this lab you will be using a fictional dataset from a Telecom Company, which includes customer information. This dataset encompasses **customer demographics**, including gender, as well as internet subscription details such as subscription plans and payment methods.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this lab will create and tune a model that will predict customer churn based on **`Churn`** field. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC A table with all features is already created for you.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Table name: `customer_churn`**

# COMMAND ----------

import mlflow.data
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# load data from the feature table
table_name = f"{DA.catalog_name}.{DA.schema_name}.customer_churn"
dataset = mlflow.data.load_delta(table_name=table_name)
pd = dataset.df.drop("CustomerID").toPandas()

# split dataset to train/test 
target_col = "Churn"
X_all = pd.drop(labels=target_col, axis=1)
y_all = pd[target_col]

# test / train split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_all, y_all, train_size=0.95, random_state=42)
print(f"We have {X_train.shape[0]} records in our training dataset")
print(f"We have {X_test.shape[0]} records in our test dataset")

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Task 1:  Define Hyperparameter Search Space
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Define the parameter search space for hyperopt. Define these hyperparameters and search space;
# MAGIC * **`max_depth`:** 2 to 30
# MAGIC * **`max_features`**: 5 to 10
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Note that both parameters are discrete values.

# COMMAND ----------

from hyperopt import hp

# define param search space

dtc_param_space = <FILL_IN>

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Task 2: Define Optimization Function
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Next, define an optimization function that will be used by hyperopt for minimizing the loss. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Make sure to follow instructions;
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * Make sure to enable MLflow run as **`nested`** experiment. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * For each run log the cross-validation results for `accuracy`, `precision`, `recall` and `f1`
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * Use **3-fold** cross validation
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * Minimize loss based on the **`precision`** score

# COMMAND ----------

from math import sqrt

import mlflow
import mlflow.data
import mlflow.sklearn

from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_validate

from hyperopt import STATUS_OK

def tuning_objective(params):
 # start an MLFlow run
 with mlflow.<FILL_IN> as mlflow_run:
    
   # Enable automatic logging of input samples, metrics, parameters, and models
   mlflow.sklearn.autolog(
       disable=False,
       log_input_examples=True,
       silent=True,
       exclusive=False)

   # set up our model estimator
   dtc = <FILL_IN>
    
   # cross-validated on the training set
   validation_scores = <FILL_IN>
   cv_results = cross_validate(<FILL_IN>)
   # log the average cross-validated results
   cv_score_results = {}
   for val_score in validation_scores:
     cv_score_results[val_score] = cv_results[f'test_{val_score}'].mean()
     mlflow.log_metric(f"cv_{val_score}", cv_score_results[val_score])

   # return the negative of our cross-validated precision score as the loss
   return <FILL_IN>

# MAGIC ## Task 3: Run Trials in Hyperopt
# MAGIC
# MAGIC After defining the *objective function*, we are ready to run this function with hyperopt. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * Use `SparkTrails` and run *3 trails* in parallel.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * Use **TPE** algorithm for optimization.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * Use maximum 3 evaluations.

# COMMAND ----------

from hyperopt import <FILL_IN>

# set the path for mlflow experiment
mlflow.set_experiment(f"/Users/{DA.username}/LAB-2-Hyperparameter-Tuning-with-Hyperopt")

# MAGIC ## Task 4: Show the Best Run Info

# COMMAND ----------

# get best trail and show the info
best_run = <FILL_IN>
best_run.<FILL_IN>

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Task 5: Search for the Best Run with MLflow API
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We just got the best run based on the loss metric in the previous step. Sometimes we might need to search for runs using custom filters such as by parent run or by another metric. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this step, search for runs of `parent_run` experiment and use following filters;
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * Filter by runs which has `FINISHED`
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * Order by **cross validation precision** score from **high to low**.

# COMMAND ----------

from mlflow.entities import ViewType

# search over all runs
hpo_runs_pd = <FILL_IN>

display(hpo_runs_pd)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Task 6: Search for the Best Run with MLflow UI
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Another way of searching for runs is to simply use the MLflow UI. In this section, we will need to review the experiment and runs and filter runs based on the same filters that are defined in the previous step but this time using the UI.

# COMMAND ----------
